User Management :

kernel processes -> idle process , init process (login)

Logout system call is used to logout the current user from the system and does not take 
any arguments. Logout system call can only be executed from the shell process (PID = 2). 



so in the current implementation , what happens is that there is option 1 for login and 2 for exit
exit refers to shutdown

you can shutdown while logged out or when u are logged in too

only root can add new user 

if others try it will try to run but will say BAD COMMAND

rest all works perfectly fine. Will add to this as we go by the next stage.
Also other system utilities are done.

lu, ls, rm, ru, cat, touch, cp
