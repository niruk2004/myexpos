Default value of timer interrupt is 20.

when will the scheduler be called?
-   from timer interrupt , when a process halts , when the running process is waiting for console input ,
    when the current process needs a resource which is occupied by another process , during the async 
    function disk load , waiting for memory page (when it is not available).

API and ABI:
    API is for the userprogram to call the systemcalls using exposcall
    ABI serves as an interface between the user program and the kernel. It consists of the virtual address 
    space model, xexe executable format,low level system call interface and the low level runtime library interface.
    The application programs will be using the high level library interface for invoking system calls. The ExpL 
    compiler is responsible for generating assembly language code to translate the call to a corresponding library 
    call using the low level library interface. The ExpL library which is pre-loaded into the system memory during 
    eXpOS boot up contains assembly language code that redirects the library call to the corresponding eXpOS system 
    call using the low level system call interface described here. If you write assembly language application 
    programs as user programs, then you can use the low level system call interface directly bye-passing the library.

XEXE format:
    header - 8 bits and code part
    header:
        XMAGIC number - 0  for all XEXE files. indicates file type
        Entry point
        text size
        data size
        heap size
        stack size
        library flag
        unused
