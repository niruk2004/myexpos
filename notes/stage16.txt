Console Input:

Disk and Console Interrupts

The XSM privileged instructions load(page_num,block_num) and store(block_num, page_num) are used 
for transfer of data from disk to memory and memory to disk. The actual data transfer involves time 
delay as disk access is slow. On encountering a load/store instruction, the XSM machine will start 
a disk transfer, increment IP by two and fetch the next instruction without waiting for the data 
transfer to be completed. When the actual disk-memory data transfer is completed, the disk controller 
will raise the disk interrupt. Similarly, the IN instruction initiates a console input but will not 
suspend machine execution till some input is read. Machine execution proceeds to the next instruction 
in the program. When the user enters data, the data is transferred to port P0, and a console interrupt 
is raised by the console device. 

After the execution of each instruction in unprivileged mode, the machine checks whether a pending 
disk/console/timer interrupt. If so, the machine does the following actions:

    *Push the IP value into the top of the stack.
    Set IP to value stored in the interrupt vector table entry for the timer interrupt handler. The 
    vector table entry for timer interrupt is located at physical address 493 in page 0 (ROM) of XSM 
    and the value 2048 is preset in this location. Hence, the IP register gets value 2048. The machine 
    then switches to to privileged mode and address translation is disabled. Hence, next instruction 
    will be fetched from physical address 2048. 

*Note: If the value in the SP register after incrementing SP is an invalid address (i.e., not in the 
range 0 to PTLR*512-1) then the machine generates an illegal memory access exception. The machine 
will re-execute steps (1) and (2) immedietly after retrun to unprivileged mode, before executing 
any other instruction in unprivileged mode.

The XSM machine enables interrupts only when the machine is executing in unprivileged mode.(If a 
previously initiated load/store/IN operation is completed while XSM is running in privileged mode, 
the machine waits for next transition to unprivileged mode before processing the interrupt.)

The most important fact about the IN instruction is that it will not wait for the data to arrive in 
P0. Instead, the XSM machine continues advancing the instruction pointer and executing the next 
instruction. Hence there must be some hardware mechanism provided by XSM to detect arrival of data in P0.

When does data arrive in P0? This happens when some string/number is entered from the key-board and 
ENTER is pressed. At this time, the XSM machine will raise the console interrupt. Thus the console 
interrupt is the hardware mechanism that helps the OS to infer that the execution of the IN instruction 
is complete. 

Since the value we took in is needed for further execution of the program that we are running, we change 
the status of the process to WAIT_TERMINAL and then call the scheduler to schedule another process while 
we wait for the input.It is the responsiblity of the console interrupt handler to transfer the data arrived 
in port P0 to the process which is waiting for the data. This is done by copying the value present in port 
P0 into the input buffer field of the process table entry of the process which has requested for the input. 
Console interrupt handler also wakes up the process in WAIT_TERMINAL by setting its state to READY. (Other 
processes in WAIT_TERMINAL state are also set to READY by the console interrupt handler.) 


When the Acquire Terminal function assigns the terminal to a process, it enters the PID of the process into 
the PID field of the terminal status table. The Terminal Read function must perform the following 
    1) Acquire the terminal 
    2) Issue an IN instruction (SPL read statement translates to XSM instruction IN) 
    3) Set its state as WAIT_TERMINAL 
    4) Invoke the scheduler 
    5) After console interrupt wakes up this process, transfer data present in the input buffer field of the 
    process table into the word address (passed as an argument).
