Program Loader:



Exec is the "program loader" of eXpOS. Exec takes as input a filename. It first checks whether 
the file is a valid eXpOS executable stored in the XSM disk, adhering to the XEXE format. If so, 
Exec destroys the invoking process, loads the executable file from the disk, and sets up the program 
for execution as a process. A successful exec operation results in the termination of the invoking 
process and hence never returns to it. 

Exec first deallocates all pages the invoking process is using. These include two heap pages, two 
user stack pages, code pages occupied by the process and the user area page. It also invalidates the 
entries of the page table of the invoking process. Note that the newly scheduled process will have 
the same PID as that of the invoking process. Hence the same process table entry and page table of 
the invoking process will be used by the newly loaded process. Exec calls the Exit Process function 
in the process manager module (module 1) to deallocate the pages and to terminate the current process.


As mentioned earlier, Exit Process function releases the user area page of the current process. Since 
Exec system call runs in kernel mode and needs a kernel stack for its own execution, after coming back 
from Exit process function, exec reclaims the same user area page for the new process. Further, exec 
acquires two heap, two stack and the required number of code pages (number of disk blocks in the inode 
entry of the file in the inode table) for the new process. New pages will be acquired by invoking the 
Get Free Page function present in the memory manager module (module 2). 




    Exit Process (function number = 3, process manager module)

    The first function invoked in the exec system call is the Exit Process function. Exit Process function 
    takes PID of a process as an argument (In this stage, PID of the current process is passed). Exit process 
    deallocates all the pages of the invoked process. It deallocates the pages present in the page table by 
    invoking another function called Free Page Table present in the same module. Further, The Exit Process 
    deallocates the user area page by invoking Free User Area Page in the same module. The state of the process 
    (corresponding to the given PID) is set to TERMINATED. This is not the final Exit process function. There 
    will be minor modifications to this function in the later stages.



    Free Page Table (function number = 4, process manager module)

    The Free Page Table function takes PID of a process as an argument (In this stage, PID of the current 
    process is passed). In the function Free Page Table , for every valid entry in the page table of the 
    process, the corresponding page is freed by invoking the Release Page function present in the memory manager 
    module. Since the library pages are shared by all the processes, do not invoke the Release Page function for 
    the library pages. Free Page Table function invalidates all the page table entries of the process with given 
    PID. The part of the Free Page Table function involving updates to the Disk Map Table will be taken care in 
    subsequent stages.



    Free User Area Page (function number = 2, process manager module)

    The function Free User Area Page takes PID of a process (In this stage, PID of the current process is passed) 
    as an argument. The user area page number of the process is obtained from the process table entry corresponding 
    to the PID. This user area page is freed by invoking the Release Page function from the memory manager module. 
    However, since we are using Free User Area Page to release the user area page of the current process one needs 
    to be careful here. The user area page holds the kernel stack of the current process. Hence, releasing this page 
    means that the page holding the return address for the call to Free User Area Page function itself has been 
    released! Neverthless the return address and the saved context of the calling process will not be lost. This 
    is because Release Page function is non blocking and hence the page will never be allocated to another process 
    before control transfers back to the caller. (Free User Area Page function also releases the resourses like files 
    and semaphores acquired by the process. We will look into it in later stages.)



    Release Page (function number = 2, memory manager module)

    The Release Page function takes the page number to be released as an argument. The Release Page function decrements 
    the value in the memory free list corresponding to the page number given as an argument. Note that we don't tamper 
    with the content of the page as the page may be shared by other processes. The system status table keeps track of 
    number of free memory pages available to use in the MEM_FREE_COUNT field. When the memory free list entry of the 
    page becomes zero, no process is currently using the page. In this case, increment the value of MEM_FREE_COUNT in 
    the system status table indicating that the page has become free for fresh allocation. Finally, Release page 
    function must check whether there are processes in WAIT_MEM state (these are processes blocked, waiting for memory 
    to become available). If so, these processes have to be set to READY state as memory has become available now. At 
    present, the OS does not set any process to WAIT_MEM state and this check is superfluous. However, in later stages, 
    the OS will set processes to WAIT_MEM state when memory is temporarily unavailable, and hence when memory is released 
    by some process, the waiting processes have to be set to READY state.



    Get Free Page (function number = 1, memory manager module)

    To acquire the pages for the new process, exec calls the module function Get Free Page. The function returns the 
    page number of the page allocated. Fundamentally, Get Free page searches through the memory free list to find a free 
    page for the allocation. If a free page is found, memory free list entry corresponding to that page is incremented 
    and number of the page found is returned.

    If no memory page is free (MEM_FREE_COUNT in the system status table is 0), then state of the process is changed to 
    WAIT_MEM and the scheduler is invoked. This process is scheduled again, when the memory is available (state of this 
    process is changed to READY by some other process). The field WAIT_MEM_COUNT in the system status table stores the 
    number of processes waiting to acquire a memory page. The Get Free Page function increments the WAIT_MEM_COUNT before 
    changing state to WAIT_MEM. The process waits in the WAIT_MEM state until any memory page is available for use. Upon 
    waking up, the Get Free Page function allocates the free memory page and updates the WAIT_MEM_COUNT and MEM_FREE_COUNT 
    in the system status table.

breakpoint was applied on beginning and end of the release page and get free page functions in module 2:
