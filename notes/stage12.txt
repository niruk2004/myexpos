Idle process:
eXpOS specifies two special processes, the idle and the init process. These are stored in a predefined 
location in the disk and loaded to the memory by the bootstrap loader. The main purpose of idle process 
is to run as a background process in an infinite loop. This is demanded by the OS so that the scheduler 
will always have a process to schedule. The init process is the first process executed by the OS. The 
process identifiers for the idle and init processes are fixed as 0 and 1 respectively.

A shell is an ExpL program which takes the name of an executable file as input and executes it. The shell 
process Forks itself and the child process invokes the Exec system call with the executable file as 
argument. The shell runs until the user stops the process. 

Before OS bootstrap, it must be stored in the disk blocks 11 and 12. The OS bootstrap loader must load 
this program to memory pages 69 and 70.. The Page Table and Process Table for the idle process must be set 
up by the bootstrap loader. The PID of the idle process is fixed to be 0.
