Difference between open instance count and file open count:
    open instance count refers to the count of the same instance acorss different processes.
    file open count refers to the total number of open files...i.e number of different instances. 
    open instance count is present in the open file table and it can have duplicate filename entry 
    but with a different lseek value denoting a different instance.


Reading from the root file does not require a buffer, as root file is already loaded into the memory at 
boot-time. Memory copy of the root file is present in memory page 62 and the start address of this page 
is denoted by the SPL constant ROOT_FILE. The word in the root file at LSEEK position is copied into the 
address provided. Note that the memory address provided as argument is a logical address, and as system 
call runs in kernel mode logical address should be translated to physical address before storing data.
